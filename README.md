# AutomationProjectsPortfolio
Hi, this is Mohammed Masood 👋
This repository showcases some of my practical work on UI Automation, API Automation, Hybrid Framework development, and Java coding practice.

This portfolio is a combination of multiple projects that demonstrate real-world automation skills including:

🔹 Functional UI Automation (Selenium WebDriver + TestNG)

🔹 Hybrid Framework Development (POM + Utilities + Reports)

🔹 API Testing (REST Assured)

🔹 Java Coding & Logic Building

🔹 Cross-browser testing, waits, actions, etc.

🔹 TestNG XML, Maven, and Jenkins readiness 

🔹 Docker with SeleniumGrid for running the testCases much more Faster

 🔹 Wrapping my action method(Selenium) with proper waiting mechanism to handle the ajax based dropdowns , and elements 

  
  

Each folder inside this portfolio contains a complete project with:

src/main/java

src/test/java

pom.xml

testng.xml

utilities, page objects, and reports

plus sample test cases
