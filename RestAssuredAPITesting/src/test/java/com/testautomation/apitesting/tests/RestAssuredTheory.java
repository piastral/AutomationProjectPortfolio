/* Rest Assured ===>>>
 * ===>WHAT IS REST ASSURED ? WHY WE NEED TO USE THE REST ASSURED?
 * ANS--> 1- Rest Assured is open source java based library to test & validate RestAPIS 
 * OR restful Webservices and there is no UI INVOLVED 
 * 
 * 2==> Rest assured supports for many HTTP METHODS SUCH AS GET,POST,PUT PATCH AND DELETE 
 * AND WE CAN PASS PARAMETER ,HEADERS & COOKIES DATA ALSO WE CAN VERIFY & validate HTTP METHOD 
 * RESPONSES 
 * 
 * 3===> Rest assured not only supports JSON based web services ,it also support to test xml based 
 * web services 
 * 
 * 4==>also we can integrate rest assured with popular testing framework such as junit & testNg 
 * also it supports maven build tools ...so technically we can create end to end framework 
 * using rest library and other component for validation purpose 
 * 
 * 
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ===> WHY WE NEED TP USE REST ASSURED ?
 * 
 * 1--> rEST aSSURED is open source java based library & it has active development community supports
 * 
 * 2-->Earlier we used dynamic programming languages such as groovy ,ruby for api test automation 
 * that was difficult to test apis 
 * 
 * 3--> using rest assured it became very easy & simple to test restful web services 
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * ===> REST ASSURED ADVANTAGES
 * 
 * 1--> OPEN SOURCE & FREE TO USE 
 * 
 * 2---> Setup ois straight forward 
 * 
 * 3--> can be easily iintegrated with testing framework
 * 
 * 4--> code will be more readable as it uses BDD APPROACH GIVEN,WHEN,THEN KEYWORDS 
 * 
 * 5--> IT DOES support testing soap api 
 * 
 * 6--> disadvantage ---> there is no inbuilt reporting mechanism 
 * 
 * ==============================================================================================
 * ADVANTAGES OF API TESTING 
 * 
 * 1--> EARLIER VALIDATION SINCE IT IS EARLY DEVELOPED 
 * 
 * 2--> EASIER TEST MAINTATINECE 
 * 
 * 3--> FASTER TIME RESOLUTION (DEVS TEAM CAN FIX THE ISSUE FAST)
 * 
 * 4---> SPPED AND COVERAGE ===>COMAPRED TO UI SOMETIMES ENVIRONEMENT ISSUE CAN COME UP WITH UI 
 * OR SERVER IS TAKING TIME TO GIVE RESPONSE OR LOADING TIME IS EXCEDDING 
 * 
 * FOR THAT API CAN BE TESTED EFFICENTLY AND 
 * 5--. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT 
 * 
 * 6--> gui independent 
 * 
 * 7--> faster releases
