/* =====================================TEST NG XML====================
 * WHAT IS TESTNG XML ?? 
 * Ans== testNg Xml file is configuration file which contains trstNg execution details ( meaning like flow of testNg)
 * 
 * 2) WHAT IS THE NEED OF TESTNG XML FILE??
 * 
 * ANS== suppose we have multiple classes and each class has n number of testMethod ,
 * but my requirment now to  execute the specific test method from each class 
 * how can we achieve that we jyst can go to the class and run the respective method it wont work 
 * instead we can configure our xml file in TestNg and mention which method from what classes should 
 * be executed thats it ...this is why we need TestNg xml file
 * 
 * 
 * 3) how to create testng.xml file ?
 * ans )) 
 * ===========================================******************=====================================
 * SO RIGHT NOW ILL FOCUS IN MY TESTNG XML FILE HOW IT IS CREATED FROM SUITE LEVEL AND WE CAN CREATE MULTIPLE TESTnG XML FILE  
 * IN REAL SCENARIO 
 * we have 1000 test cases  lets say i have first class two class third class
 * Firstclass==> A ,B(testMethod)
 * Second class ==> C,D,E
 * Third class==> F,G,H,I,J
 * 
 * LETS Say now my option is i want to to execute only selective method from this classes lets say 
 *  lets say ill execute B,E,H SO TO execute this everytime ill not come to the class for execution purpose i can simple create 
 *  one testNg xml file so that is is the configuration file we will mention in this file what we want to execute and in order we will 
 *  execute 
 *  
 * hierarchy in testNG.XML 
 * WE WILL HAVE SUITE --> Test--> classes--->class--->method
 * inside suite there will test inside test there will be class 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
