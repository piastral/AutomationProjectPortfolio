/*TOP SCENARIO BASED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR CICD 🚀
1. Scenario: Your team’s build time has increased significantly over the past few sprints. How would you address this issue? ✨
Answer:
- Analyze Build Pipeline: Review each step in the build pipeline to identify bottlenecks. 
Look at logs, monitor system performance, and review code changes.
- Parallel Builds: Implement parallel execution for independent tasks.
- Caching: Use caching mechanisms for dependencies, containers, or artifacts to avoid redundant work.
- Optimize Test Suite: Optimize the test suite by identifying and running only the necessary tests, 
possibly using a test impact analysis tool.
- Incremental Builds: Implement incremental builds that only compile changed code rather than the entire 
codebase.

2. Scenario: A deployment failed in production, causing a critical outage. How do you handle the
 situation and ensure it doesn’t happen again? ✨
Answer:
- Immediate Rollback: Trigger an immediate rollback to the last known stable version to restore service.
- Root Cause Analysis: Perform a root cause analysis to determine why the deployment failed. Check logs, 
code changes, and configuration files.
- Implement CI/CD Guardrails: Implement safety checks, such as automated smoke tests, canary releases, and 
blue-green deployments.
- Monitoring & Alerts: Ensure that robust monitoring and alerting systems are in place to catch potential
 issues early.
- Documentation: Document the incident and update the deployment process to prevent recurrence.

3. Scenario: You need to integrate a new tool into the existing CI/CD pipeline, but it’s not directly
 supported by your current setup. What’s your approach? ✨
Answer:
- Evaluate Compatibility: Assess whether the new tool has plugins or APIs that can integrate with the 
existing CI/CD tools.
- Custom Scripting: Write custom scripts to integrate the tool using available APIs or CLI options.
- Dockerization: Containerize the tool and use it as part of the pipeline to ensure compatibility and 
reproducibility.
- Community Support: Check if the tool has community plugins or integrations that could be used or modified.
- Testing: Thoroughly test the integration in a staging environment before rolling it out to production.


4. Scenario: Your team is moving from a monolithic architecture to microservices. 
How would you adjust your CI/CD pipeline to accommodate this change? ✨
Answer:
- Automated Testing: Implement contract testing between services and ensure end-to-end integration tests.
- Containerization: Containerize each microservice for consistent deployment across environments.
- Service Discovery: Ensure that your deployment includes service discovery mechanisms to manage service interactions.
- Monitoring & Logging: Enhance monitoring and logging to capture service-specific metrics and logs, and aggregate them for centralized monitoring.
